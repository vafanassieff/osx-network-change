# osx-network-change

This is .plist file who will trigger a script when a network change is detected
I was fed up to reconnect my Time Machine on my nas everytime i came home so i made this solution

The *networkchange.plist* source is [here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/32354/how-do-you-run-a-script-after-a-network-interface-comes-up) thanks to [laurent](https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/176602/laurent)

## Install

If like me you want to mount a drive you have to load the .plist as root or it will be launched as the current user and you wont be able to mount your network drive

Change the script path in networkchange.plist line 12

Edit the *network_change.sh* with your own values

Change the owner of *networkchange.plist* and the  *network_change.sh* to root:wheel

```
sudo chown root:wheel networkchange.plist
sudo chown root:wheel network_change.sh
```

Load and start the service

```
sudo launchctl load networkchange.plist
sudo launchctl start networkchange
```

Change the owner of the . to root

If you want to stop the service

```
sudo launchctl stop networkchange
sudo launchctl remove networkchange
```
And voil√† !
